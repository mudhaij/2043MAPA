                          <p>Hello, my name is Sebbie and I'm the host of Wise Up To Waste. I came up with the concept of a quiz show that educates and entertains the individuals who watch and hopefully inspire a change in them. I think making our audience aware of the issue of food waste in the UK is really important as it has huge economical, social and environmental impacts on our society.</p>
