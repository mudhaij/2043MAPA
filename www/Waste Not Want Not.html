            <h2><p> The amount of food waste produced globally each year is more than enough to feed the nearly 1 billion hungry people in the world. Cutting back on food waste is incredibly easy and here we are sharing with you some practical ideas on reducing the amount of food you waste </p></h2>
          <p>Go <a href="#" class="back">back</a> or go to <a href="about.html">About</a> page.</p>
          <p>Keep Track of Waste: Every day, write down the foods that you waste in your household; no matter the reason it was waste, make a note of it. At the end of the week, take a look at the amount of food that you are wasting. Maybe even add up the total cost of this wasted food. Think about how much money you're wasting and fix up!</p>
          <p>Take time to check date labels for use by dates, review portioning, storage and use up those leftovers</p> 
          <p> Grow Your Own: Gardening is a great pastime, and it can eliminate waste since you grow only what you need</p>
          <p>Freeze It: When a product expiration date is nearing and you cannot prepare the item before this date, throw it in the freezer. Most items will last at least 30 more days when properly stored inside the fridge</p>
            <p>Eat Leftovers: Rather than toss the leftovers from dinner, wrap them up and put them in the fridge. Leftovers make great lunches for work and if you’re a small family, they’re just as great for second night meals. You get the benefit of not cooking so there is more time on your hands.</p>
            <p> If you are shopping frequently you are more likely to purchase foods that you don’t really need. Schedule a once per week shopping day and avoid going any more frequently.

</p>
            <p>Take a Pledge: Pledge to stop food waste and make a commitment to that pledge. You’ll feel great when you take the pledge, and you’ll save money!</p>
